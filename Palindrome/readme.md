# Palindrome
    
    # An Implementation of class "Palindrome"
    
    # An interactive C++ project that mostly practicing operators overloading
    
    # Also practicing the following:
    
    OOP Programming
        Objects
        Classes
        Encapsulation
        Copy Constructors
        Destructors
        
    Concepts
        Const
        Reference
        This
        Function Overloading
        Operators Overloading
        Object Lifecycle, Convertions
    
    Dynamic Memory Allocations
        new
        delete
        0 memory leaks
        
    Advanced Programming
        Macro
        
    Multiple Files Compilation Modules
        Compile multiple files into one output. 
        
    Strings
        Advanced use of <string.h> library
